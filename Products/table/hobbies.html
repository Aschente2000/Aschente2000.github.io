			<p> While I don't know if it is to be considered a hobbie, I love to read within my spare time!</p>
			<p>On top of that I also work at Barnes&Noble, which helps me pay for the books I love to read!</p>
			<p>I would say that I read roughly 2-3 hours a day at least. I also probably go to buy books about every</p>
			<P>2-3 weeks and buy about 2-3 books per a visit. However books can be pretty expensive at times with school and car payments,</p>
			<P> though I try to buy books whenever I can or use a library when its to expensive. Going off of that, when it comes to books</p>
			<p> I am somewhat of a collector and I like to own the books and their entire series, so I typically avoid libraries, considering</p>
			<p> I can't keep the books. As for what kind of books I read, usually I read fantasy or sci-fi and I not too fond of non-fiction books.</p>
			<p>And that basically sums up my hobbie for reading!</p>
